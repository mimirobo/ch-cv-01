# MNIST Classification Model:


## Problem Definition:
Utilize the MNIST dataset, which consists images of handwritten single digits from 0 to 9.
The task is to classify these images into one of the 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9.

### Model Training:
Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit classification from scratch.
Create a model with layers like Flatten, Dense, Dropout, and Softmax activation.
Compile the model using any optimizers you prefer and any loss functions.
Train the model on the training data.

### Evaluation:
After training, evaluate the model using a confusion matrix to assess its performance.
Calculate the confusion matrix by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels of the test data.
